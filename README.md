# SQLCompiler
Automatic Compiler for SQLite using text files. Made for University of Washington Bothell CSS 475 Database System course.

## How to use
- Give the program the path to the sqlite3.exe by clicking the button.
- Select all the .txt files that you want to compile.
- Click compile. The program will run the .txt files in sqlite, and create an output in a folder called "Result" which will be in the same directory as the .txt files that you selected in the earlier step.
